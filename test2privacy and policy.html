You should be aware that there are certain things that Community Service will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the site will require the site to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Community Service cannot take responsibility for the engines  not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the site outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.
